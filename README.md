# Personal Portfolio

This is a simple personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a homepage, About Me, and Projects sections with a responsive dark theme.

How to preview locally:

- Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder with a simple static server.

Using Python (if installed):

```powershell
# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Or with Node.js and http-server:

```powershell
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```
